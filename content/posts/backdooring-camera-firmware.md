RIT's Competitive Cybersecurity Club (*RC3*) held it's 2nd annual Incident Response Security Competition (*IRSeC*) in May and I once again had the privilege to be on both the red and white teams! This year we had IP cameras to play with, so one of my buddies <a href="https://github.com/muchosecureo">Nikko</a> on the white team and I decided to try to mess with the firmware.

We had 9 *D-Link DCS-930L Rev. B2* cameras; eight for teams and one <s>to brick</s> for testing. We wanted to accomplish a few things:
<div><ul>
    <li>Install sshd for pivoting,</li>
    <li>Make telnetd listen and provide unauthenticated access, and</li>
    <li>Modify some pages on the web UI</li>
</ul></div>
But first we had to figure out <strong>where do we start</strong>? Our first thought was to dive right into reversing the firmware update image to try and find a filesystem to modify. We were able to download the image from the <a href="http://support.dlink.com/ProductInfo.aspx?m=DCS-930L">D-Link website</a>.

## Diving in with Binwalk
The firmware archive contains a PDF with firmware release notes and a bin file (the image). Running *binwalk* on the image yields the following:
```

Looks like there are two sections of interest underneath "uImage" headers. The first section at the start of the binary seems to contain something called "U-Boot". What is U-Boot? It is a first- and second- stage bootloader that is used for embedded devices. You can read more about it on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Das_U-Boot U-Boot). The other uImage is a Linux Kernel Image. Since we are looking for the filesystem, the Linux Kernel Image seems like the path to go down from here. It can be extracted with *dd*.

```
Uh oh. That's not good. We know that the magic on that section of the firmware binary indicates LZMA and because it failed at 95.7% we can look at the end of the file for issues.

Seems like it is just padding, with 4 bytes at the end that we will get back to later.
To take off the padding we needed to find the last line of data before the "ffff"s start. This can be done using  *xxd*, *fgrep*, and *tail* .
```
→ xxd linux.bin.lzma | fgrep -v '................' | tail

```
The last line is the same as the previous dump, so we ignore it. We see above that the lines of all "ffff"s start at 0x388950+14. We plug this number into *dd* as the count to copy and try the decompression again.

```

Success! The next logical step is to check out the newly extracted linux.bin with *binwalk*.

Quite a few entries. Grepping out the word "path" yields less.

Two LZMA compressed sections! We then extracted them from the binary and attempted decompression.
```
→ dd if=linux.bin of=linux1.bin.lzma bs=1 skip=1108304 count=$((3256396-1108304))

linux2.bin.lzma (1/1)
  100 %   2,459.7 KiB / 7,936.5 KiB = 0.310
```

It doesn't seem like the *lzma* utility even attempted to extract the contents of linux1.bin.lzma. Better luck was had with linux2.bin.lzma, so we went down this path further.

Running *binwalk* against the newly extracted binary yields the following:
```

Lots of CPIO archive data here. It turns out that it's just a single CPIO! This certainly looks promising because there are Linux filesystem paths in the output. We extracted it using the *cpio* utility. (the Mac version of *cpio* does not come with the *--no-absolute-filenames* option, so this was done on Linux)

```
$ mkdir extract && mv linux2.bin $_ && cd $_
$ cpio -i --no-absolute-filenames < linux2.bin
cpio: Removing leading `/' from member names
15873 blocks
$ ls
bin  etc     home  lib         media  mydlink  sbin  tmp  var
dev  etc_ro  init  linux2.bin  mnt    proc     sys   usr
```
Jackpot! Looks like a valid Linux filesystem!
<img width="300px" class="uk-align-center" src="/images/money.gif" />

## Examining the filesystem
We decided to check out the */etc_ro* directory first, because that is where startup scripts and other configurations live.
```
→ ls -l etc_ro

```

Usually files that start with rc are startup scripts, so we examined *rcS*.

## Trying to re-pack the firmware

## Getting the source

## Issues compiling

## Issues flashing
Before doing any real backdooring, we tested remote communication by undoing Andy's work of commenting out telnetd on startup and enabling it from that rcS file in /etc_ro. With telnetd running at startup it was time to re-pack the firmware and load it to the device. Neither of us had physical access to the device so we yolo'd and the update was done over the internet. With a couple of hours between when the update was pushed and my friend was able to head home to check if the push was successful, signs from DDNS weren't great.

Getting access to the device showed that it was in fact not good. On a cycle of about 3 seconds, a Red and Blue LED would light up, then go dark, then light up again. It was stuck in a loop, but there was no way to tell what it was stuck on over the network. That's where the <a href="https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/d-link/dcs-930l">OpenWRT wiki</a> saved the day. The DCS-930L has 4 blank headers (G,Rx,Tx,Vbatt) for a serial connection which was the only way to recover from this.
<img width="300px" class="uk-align-center" src="/images/dcs930l.jpg" alt="Source: OpenWRT"/>
Upon getting leads soldered to the headers, next was opening a screen session using the software settings 57600 8N1. After a few reboots it was clear that it was a firmware issue.
```
Uncompressing Kernel Image ... LZMA ERROR 1 - must RESET board to recover
```
Luckily we had console access via a Universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter(UART).

## Backdooring telnetd

## Installing sshd

## Installing <s>sshd</s> dropbear

## Making space
Initially working with sshd presented some issues we didn't account for like the binary being 2MB and a total space of 4MB to work with. Right there half our usable space was gone and the camera's firmware binary was *some size* . Pushing the limits of storage we decided to pack the firmware, however it was still too big. Eventually we ripped out all the Java Applet programs from the camera's binary.
## Missing web front-end
After ripping Java from the camera's binary in an effort to save space, it broke motion and sound detection.
## Results

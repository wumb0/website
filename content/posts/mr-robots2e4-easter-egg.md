After seeing [the last Mr. Robot easter egg](http://imgur.com/gallery/RKRAi) from season 2 episode 1 I have been on the lookout for IP's and domains to try and go after. At the end of season 2 episode 4 (init_1.asec) Elliot logs into an IRC server and the IP address is clearly visible as **192.251.68.53**.
![ip]({filename}/images/mrrobotip.png)

I decided to scan that host with nmap and got the following results:
```bash
â†’ sudo nmap -sS -Pn -sV -n 192.251.68.253
Starting Nmap 7.12 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2016-07-28 08:46 EDT
Nmap scan report for 192.251.68.253
Host is up (0.023s latency).

PORT     STATE SERVICE     VERSION

80/tcp   open  http-proxy  F5 BIG-IP load balancer http proxy
554/tcp  open  rtsp?
7070/tcp open  realserver?
Service Info: Device: load balancer
```

HTTP up, cool. I went to the site and it was a fake IRC server with the hostname irc.colo-solutions.net:
![irc]({filename}/images/mrrobotirc.png)

After it logged me in as *D0loresH4ze* I was dropped in a channel called *#th3g3ntl3man* with the all too familiar *samsepi0l* (for the uninformed, Sam Sepiol was the alias Elliot used in season one to gain access to Steel Mountain, a secure datacenter). 

After poking around and trying to get samsepi0l to say something besides "i don't have time for this right now." I played the roll of Darlene and entered what she said in the show:

Here is the respone I got:

> they have changed their standard issue. we have a way in.

What does that even mean? At the end of the episode this line of dialogue was not shown. Only *wait for my instructions* was. After this I investigated a couple of other IP addresses I found (192.251.68.240, 104.97.14.93, 192.251.68.249) but none of them turned up anything. I looked at the page source too, hoping to find something hidden in the javascript or HTML. Nothing there either... I guess we will just have to wait and see where this goes! I'll probably take a closer look at this after work, but I thought this would be cool to share now.
